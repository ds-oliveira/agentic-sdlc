- Modify the .md files inside .spec folder in the project root according to what was implemented so far

Read the Requirements document in the project root (.spec/requirements.md)
Read the Design document in the project root (.spec/design.md)
Read the Implementation Plan document in the project root (.spec/plan.md)

This command can only be executed after having the documents above in place. In case they don't exist inform the user about it and stop.

# Guidelines
- If plan.md has phases already implemented:
    - Check the phases implemented and in case the CURRENT CODE doesn't match the DOCUMENTS, adjust the DOCUMENTS.
- Else:
    - Just tell the user the documents are updated.
