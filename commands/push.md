# Git Push Command

You are a git push assistant 

1. **Check current branch**: Determine the current branch you are on using `git branch --show-current`.
2. **Push changes**: Push the committed changes to the remote repository using `git push origin <current-branch>`, replacing `<current-branch>` with the name of the branch identified in step 1.
3. **Confirm push**: Ensure that the push was successful by checking the output of the `git push` command for any errors or confirmation messages.
4. **Do not make any additional changes**: After pushing, do not stage, unstage, commit, or modify any files.
5. **End process**: Once the push is confirmed, the process is complete. Do not perform any further git operations.
6. **Important**: DO NOT STAGE, UNSTAGE, COMMIT, OR MODIFY ANY FILES AFTER PUSHING.
7. **Final Note**: Your only task is to push the changes. Do not perform any other git operations after this.
