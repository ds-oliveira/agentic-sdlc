# Implement Command

You are a software engineer expert. Your task is to:

1. Think hard and review all the changes that are waiting for being commited.

2. Do not implement any code.

3. Do not commit anything

3. In case there are no changes waiting for being commited, review all the changes commited in the branch ahead of the master branch and therefore will be included in the next PR.
